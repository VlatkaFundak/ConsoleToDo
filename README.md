Console to do application

My fist application where I have been introduced features of OOP in practise.
To do app enables you to add, delete and complete your daily tasks in one place.
Features:
- registration and login via email adress( an activation code is sent to your email address for further step in registration)
- supports multiple users
- one user per email
- adds, deletes, completes tasks
- sends an email for every change in the app
- view of previously completed tasks
